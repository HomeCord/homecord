> [!IMPORTANT]
> HomeCord is now deprecated, and will be fully shut down sometime in May 2025.
> 
> The developer apologises for this decision. This is not something he wanted to do, but a mixture of financial struggles (not being able to pay for HomeCord's hosting anymore) and Discord [hiring a new CEO](https://discord.com/blog/passing-the-torch) from Activision Blizzard's upper management means that HomeCord's developer no longer has the passion for making Discord Apps/Bots that he once did.
> 
> HomeCord's code (where you are right now) will remain open-sourced, but archived.
