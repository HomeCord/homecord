> [!IMPORTANT]
> HomeCord is now deprecated, and will be fully shut down sometime in May 2025.
> 
> The developer apologises for this decision. This is not something he wanted to do, but financial struggles (not being able to pay for HomeCord's hosting anymore) mean he has to start cutting his expenses down, and hosting HomeCord was one of his largest expenses.
> 
> Plus, he wants to move onto expanding his programming skillset, and not just solely make Discord Apps/Bots.
> 
> HomeCord's code (where you are right now) will remain open-sourced, but archived.

<!-- For those stalking the edit history: I removed the note about Discord's change in CEO because I learnt some *actual* facts that brought me back "on the fence" about Humam, rather than being fully against him as CEO. In other words: I'm willing to give Humam a chance. -->
